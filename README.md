There once was a person from Waterloo\
Who had both a son and a daughterloo\
But none of his kids\
Knew where that place is\
And that is a real shame I think. Really. Shining how do you not know

In my defense\

There once was a Swedish pop band
with a palindromical brand
so Benny and Frida
and Bjorn and Agnetha
wrote songs about the Mexican Revolution. What the hell guys you're from Sweden in the 70s. I'm writing this bc Rhymezone lists "Fernand" as a rhyme for "band".
